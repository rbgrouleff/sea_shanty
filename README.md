# SeaShanty

SeaShanty is a tiny library that records HTTP interactions and replays responses for requests it has seen before.

The primary purpose is to speed up your test suite regardless of which test framework used by not relying on the network.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sea_shanty'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sea_shanty

## Usage

The following is a minimal example of how to use SeaShanty.

```ruby
require "rubygems"
require "sea_shanty"
require "minitest"
require "faraday"

SeaShanty.configure do |config|
  config.storage_dir = "fixtures/sea_shanty"
end
SeaShanty.intercept(:faraday)

class TestSeaShanty < Minitest::Test
  def test_fetch
    response = Faraday.get("https://example.com")
    assert_equal(200, response.status)
  end
end
```

The first time the test above is run, the request is sent as normal, because SeaShanty hasn't seen it before, and the request and response is stored, before the response is returned. On subsequent runs of the test, no requests will be sent over the network. Instead the response is loaded from the storage directory and returned.

**CAUTION!**

To prevent storing sensitive information like `Authorization` headers or credentials in the request body, use the `Configuration#request_body_filter` and `Configuration#request_headers_filter` described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### Interccept requests in an HTTP library

The following call intercepts requests made with Faraday.

```ruby
SeaShanty.intercept :faraday
```

Any HTTP requests made before the call to `SeaShanty.intercept` will not be handled by SeaShanty.

### Configuration

* `storage_dir`
  * The storage directory for the requests and responses.
  * A string that can either be an absolute path or a path relative to `Dir.pwd`
* `bypass`
  * Tells if SeaShanty should be bypassed
  * A boolean. If it is true, SeaShanty will not look up or store responses, but just pass the request to the HTTP library
  * This can be overwritten by setting the environment variable `SEA_SHANTY_BYPASS`
* `readonly`
  * Tells if SeaShanty should allow the HTTP library to send the request over the network
  * A boolean. If it is true, no requests are sent over the network. Instead SeaShanty will raise a `SeaShanty::UnknownRequest` error, if the request has not been seen before
  * This can be overwritten by setting the environment variable `SEA_SHANTY_READONLY`
* `generic_responses`
  * Tells SeaShanty to return generic responses whenever the request url matches one of the keys
  * A hash where the keys are `Regexp`s and the values are strings with the path to a file with a stored response relative to the `storage_dir`
  * The request url is matched against the `Regexp`s, and the first match will make SeaShanty return the response stored in the file with the path in the hash value
* `request_body_filter`
  * Is applied to the request body before figuring out if the request has been seen before, and before the request and response is saved
  * A callable object with an arity of 1.
  * Is called with the raw request body
  * Must return the filtered body
* `request_headers_filter`
  * Is applied to the request headers before the request and response is saved
  * A callable object with an arity of 2
  * Is called once with each header name and value
  * Must return the filtered value

### Creating your own interceptor

Any object responding to `intercept!` and `remove` can be registered as interceptors in SeaShanty by calling `SeaShanty.register_interceptor(:identifier, interceptor)`.

The `intercept!` method must be able to take an instance of a `SeaShanty::RequestStore` as its sole argument.

#### Using the RequestStore

When intercepting a request from the HTTP library, a `SeaShanty::Request` should be instantiated like so:

```ruby
request = SeaShanty::Request.new(method: "GET", url: "https://example.com", headers: {}, body: "")
```

The `method` should be a String or symbol, `url` should be a String or an `URI`, `headers` should be a hash, and `body` a String or `nil`.

This `Request` objejct is then passed to `RequestStore#fetch` together with a block that takes no parameters and returns a `SeaShanty::Response`.

If the response is not loaded from the request store, the block is instead called.

To build a `Response` object use the initializer:

```ruby
SeaShanty::Response.new(status: 200, message: "OK", headers: {}, body: "", original_response: response_from_library)
```

The `status` should be an Integer, `message` a String or `nil`, `headers` should be a hash, `body` a String or `nil`. `original_response` is optional provided as a convenience.

When `RequestStore#fetch` returns the response, it is the interceptor's responsibility to convert the `Response` object into a format the library understands. If the block to `fetch` was called, and `original_response` is set, `Response#was_stored?` is `true`, and the response from the HTTP library is available in `Response#original_response`. Otherwise the interceptor can retrieve the data from the `Response` object using attributes similarly named as the named parameters in the initializer.

#### Registering an interceptor

The Faraday interceptor is registered like so in `lib/sea_shanty/faraday.rb`:

```ruby
require "sea_shanty/faraday/interceptor"

SeaShanty.register_interceptor :faraday, SeaShanty::Faraday::Interceptor.new
```

### Supported HTTP libraries

In the current version [Faraday](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/) is the only library SeaShanty supports.

## Future development

- [ ] Add interceptors for more HTTP libraries
- [ ] Add optional response body compression to reduce storage requirements
- [ ] Make it possible to overwrite stored requests and responses
- [ ] More? Create an issue or send a pull request, if you think something is missing ðŸŽ‰

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

Before creating a pull request, please make sure `rake test` passes, and `rake standard` has no suggestions.

## Releasing a new version

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

The SeaShanty versioning scheme follows [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
